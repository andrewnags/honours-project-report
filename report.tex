\chapter{Association Schemes}
  \section{Distance-Regular Graphs}

  \section{Association Schemes}
    \subsection{The Bose-Mesner Algebra?}
      I'm not convinced this necessitates its own (sub)section, but I figured I'd
      throw it in for now and remove it later if need be.

  \section{$P$-Polynomial Schemes}

  \section{Automorphisms of Association Schemes}

  \section{Translation Schemes}

\chapter{Delsarte's Linear Programming Bound}
  \section{Linear Programming}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Basics of Linear Programming
      \item Duality
      \item Algorithms?
    \end{itemize}

  \section{The LP Bound}

  \section{The Hoffman Ratio Bound}

  \section{The Clique-Coclique Bound}

\chapter{The Hamming Scheme}
  \section{Eigenvalues}
    I'm not sure that I should include a section on the eigenvalues of the Hamming
    graph, but I think it's a neat application of a number of the ideas discussed
    in the paper, so I thought we might include it?

  \section{Schrijver's SDP Bound}

  \section{Coding Theory}
    I'm also not sure if I should include a section like this, but seeing as
    coding theory was the original motivation behind Delsarte's LP bound,
    and it remains (presumably?) a strong motivator for this theory,
    I figured it might be interesting to mention this as an application.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Basics of Coding Theory
      \item Linear Graphs
      \item Finite Vector Spaces
    \end{itemize}

\chapter{Computation}
  I wasn't sure if I ought to mention anything about the code I've written for
  this project (or even if there's anything worth saying that won't be covered
  elsewhere in the report).

  Also, if there are some specific results that would be interesting to show,
  but do not fit naturally into other sections of the report, then perhaps they
  could go here as well.

\appendix

\chapter{Linear Algebra}
  \section{The Spectral Theorem}

\chapter{Group Theory}
  \section{Group Actions}

  \section{Character Theory}

\chapter{Notation}
  I've included these sections mostly as an excuse to add the citations to the
  bibliography, though it may be somewhat useful to have a sort of guide to the
  similarities and differences in notation in this report, as well as in the
  references.
