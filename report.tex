\chapter{Association Schemes}
  \section{Distance-Regular Graphs}
    I'm not sure if I should maybe merge this section with $P$-polynomial
    section?

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Definition
      \item Basic parameters
      \item Examples?
    \end{itemize}

  \section{Association Schemes}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Definition(s)
      \item Examples?
      \item Basic parameters
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{The Bose-Mesner Algebra?}
      I'm not convinced this necessitates its own (sub)section, but I figured I'd
      throw it in for now and remove it later if need be.
      If I'm going to discuss Schrijver's SDP bound in any detail,
      it might be worth having two subsections, one for the Bose-Mesner algebra,
      and the other for the Terwilliger algebra.

  \section{$P$-Polynomial Schemes}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Definitions
      \item ``Equivalence" to DRGs
    \end{itemize}

    If we want to focus on the LP bound and translation schemes, I'm not sure
    that this section is necessary, but it is very interesting and provides an
    important class of examples.

  \section{Automorphisms of Association Schemes}
    This section may be merged with the following section.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Action of a regular group of automorphisms
      \item Cayley graphs
      \item Eigenspaces from characters
    \end{itemize}

  \section{Translation Schemes}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Equitable partitions of matrices
      \item Group partitions yielding association schemes
      \item Dual schemes? (Interesting, but not particularly necessary for the
        rest of this report)
    \end{itemize}

\chapter{Delsarte's Linear Programming Bound}
  \section{Linear Programming}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Basics of Linear Programming -- done
      \item Duality -- done
      \item Algorithms?
    \end{itemize}

  \section{The LP Bound}

  \section{The Hoffman Ratio Bound}

  \section{The Clique-Coclique Bound}

\chapter{The Hamming Scheme}
  \section{Eigenvalues}
    I'm not sure that I should include a section on the eigenvalues of the Hamming
    graph, but I think it's a neat application of a number of the ideas discussed
    in the paper, so I thought we might include it?

  \section{Schrijver's SDP Bound}

  \section{Coding Theory}
    I'm also not sure if I should include a section like this, but seeing as
    coding theory was the original motivation behind Delsarte's LP bound,
    and it remains (presumably?) a strong motivator for this theory,
    I figured it might be interesting to mention this as an application.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Basics of Coding Theory
      \item Linear Graphs
      \item Finite Vector Spaces
    \end{itemize}

\chapter{Computation}
  I wasn't sure if I ought to mention anything about the code I've written for
  this project (or even if there's anything worth saying that won't be covered
  elsewhere in the report).

  Also, if there are some specific results that would be interesting to show,
  but do not fit naturally into other sections of the report, then perhaps they
  could go here as well.

\appendix

\chapter{Linear Algebra}
  \section{The Spectral Theorem}

  \section{Adjacency Matrices}
    Basic results about the spectra of adjacency matrices, which may be used
    elsewhere in the report.  E.g. the sum of eigenvalues with multiplicity, and
    consequences.

  \section{Positive-Semi Definite Matrices}
    Depending on which proof of the clique-coclique bound I use, and how much
    detail I go into Schrijver's SDP bound, I could make some comments about PSD
    matrices.

\chapter{Group Theory}
  \section{Group Actions}
    Definitions, terms used in the report (regular, transitive, etc.) and basic
    results used.

  \section{Character Theory}
    Definition, and basic results used.

\chapter{Notation}
  I've included these sections mostly as an excuse to add the citations to the
  bibliography, though it may be somewhat useful to have a sort of guide to the
  similarities and differences in notation in this report, as well as in the
  references.  (At least, I would find such a thing useful.)
