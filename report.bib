@book{pless,
    abstract = {A complete introduction to the many mathematical tools used to
        solve practical problems in coding. Mathematicians have been fascinated
            with the theory of error-correcting codes since the publication of
            Shannon's classic papers fifty years ago. With the proliferation of
            communications systems, computers, and digital audio devices that
            employ error-correcting codes, the theory has taken on practical
            importance in the solution of coding problems. This solution process
            requires the use of a wide variety of mathematical tools and an
            understanding of how to find mathematical techniques to solve
            applied problems. Introduction to the Theory of Error-Correcting
            Codes, Third Edition demonstrates this process and prepares students
            to cope with coding problems. Like its predecessor, which was
            awarded a three-star rating by the Mathematical Association of
            America, this updated and expanded edition gives readers a firm
            grasp of the timeless fundamentals of coding as well as the latest
            theoretical advances. This new edition features: * A greater
            emphasis on nonlinear binary codes * An exciting new discussion on
            the relationship between codes and combinatorial games * Updated and
            expanded sections on the Vashamov-Gilbert bound, van Lint-Wilson
            bound, BCH codes, and Reed-Muller codes * Expanded and updated
            problem sets. Introduction to the Theory of Error-Correcting Codes,
        Third Edition is the ideal textbook for senior-undergraduate and
            first-year graduate courses on error-correcting codes in
            mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering.},
